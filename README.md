The research lab Noachlly Global Pharmacetics Drugs & Medicine Inc. needed a protein visualizer to make the world understand its reserches. It works wirh the protein's databaseL the PDB (Protein Data Bank).

This app will let you visualize protein models according to standardized representation. It uses the framework imposed by the lab: SceneKit which is a high-level 3D graphics framework allowing you to create 3D animated scenes and effects.

It encorporates a physics engine, particle generatoe, and easy ways to script the actions of 3D objects so you can describe your scene in terms og its content - geometry, materials, lights, and cameras - then animate it by describing changes to those objects.
